# SmartAttendance-Manager
This is an android app which takes the attendance of the whole class in a matter of few minutes. Those days where the teacher
has to call from roll 1 to roll 60 is long gone. 
We provide a fast and a better way to take the attendance and even without anyone having to do anything. 

The app uses the wifi hotspot on the students' android phone and the wifi on the teacher's android phone, it will connect to
individual wifi hotspots and mark the student present.
